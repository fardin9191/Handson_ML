I participated in IEEE PES DATATHON 2020 few days ago. This was a kaggle competition.The task was-
Use machine learning to create a model that predicts Global Horizontal Solar Irradiance (GHI) from a set of features(Temparature,pressure,wind speed,wind direction,precipitation,relative_humidity)
Here,

*global_horizontal_irradiance -> Global Horizontal Solar Irradiance (W/m2)
*precipitation -> Precipitation (mm)
*atmospheric_pressure -> Atmospheric Pressure (mm Hg)
*relative_humidity -> Relative Humidity (%)
*air_temperature -> Air Temperature (degree celsius)
*wind_direction -> Wind Direction (degree north)
*wind_speed -> Wind Speed (m/s)
